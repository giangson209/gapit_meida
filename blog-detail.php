                    <h3>How to Create Ongoing Value</h3>
                    <p>Marketing is a stressful job, especially when you’re trying to create a strong SaaS marketing strategy. You have to worry about how your brand is perceived externally—and, with the constant pressure of stakeholders, you often need to worry about how your marketing team is perceived internally. Although marketing is one of the most important things you can invest in during a recession, stakeholders are often more critical of marketing in these times, so demonstrating your value and getting real results from your SaaS marketing strategy is more important than ever.
                        Luckily, as Databricks‘ Bryan Saftler reminded us on episode 1 of our new Best Story Wins podcast, there are three key ways that any marketer can improve their performance (and get valuable insights in the process).</p>
                    <h3>How to Revamp Your SaaS Marketing Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Marketing is all about getting your message in front of the right people, and to do that, you need to go where your audience is. There are more channels than ever before, and new ones are popping up all the time. You don’t have to incorporate every single channel into your SaaS marketing strategy, but experimenting with a new channel—or the ways you use existing channels—can give you unexpected results.
                        If you’re short on resources or time, look for ways to reuse existing content to experiment with a new channel. For example, you might turn a popular e-book into a webinar presentation, or live stream a Q&A with an in-house expert on YouTube. (Live-streaming is particularly great as it allows you to connect with your audience in real-time, creating a sense of urgency and authenticity that other channels can’t match.)</p>

                    <h3>How to share behind the scenes of your company.</h3>
                    <p>SaaS is a very competitive field, and one of the biggest ways to differentiate your brand is to showcase who you are and what you care about. One of the best ways to build a connection with your audience is to show them what goes on behind the scenes of your company. People are curious by nature, and they love to see how things work. By sharing behind-the-scenes content, you can give your audience a glimpse into your company’s culture, values, and processes—and humanize your brand in the process.
                        For example, you could create a video series that shows how your products are made, from concept to final production. Or you could share photos and stories from company events or volunteer activities. You could even create a blog or social media series that showcases the daily life of your employees.
                        By sharing behind-the-scenes content, you can build trust and credibility with your audience. They’ll see that you’re transparent and authentic, which will make them more likely to do business with you.
                        Tip: There are all sorts of ways to spotlight your culture. See our tips to master culture marketing, show off your culture on social media, and even turn your team into content creators themselves.</p>
